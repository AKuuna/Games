# Games

This repository is grouping all the smaller mini-game projects that I'm working on.

Mostly they are based on HTML, CSS and JS. 
These games are created with mindset to be played on web. 

<h2>Sapper</h2>

[Sapper Game](https://github.com/AKuuna/Games/tree/main/AKSapper/index.html)

Clone of a well known Sapper from Windows basic games.

The purpose is to uncover all the tiles that doesn't have a bomb while leaving bomb tiles untouched. On near bomb tiles there is number that informs how many bomb tiles are sticking to this tile.

There are a few different color themes, try with one work best for you buy pushing buttons :)

<h2>Master Mind</h2>

In tis game you have 11 tries to guess 4 color code that program prepared. 

From lowest row you can fill 4 dots with colors from color chart. When your color code is ready push submit button. 
Program will respond with some hint. Black dot means one color is placed in correct position, white dot informs that one color exist but is not in is't proper placement. 
Next guess is to be filled in one row above.
